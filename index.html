        <p class="lead mb-4">This did not sit well with people because they felt as if they were being forced to be vaccinated to avoid all the hassle and cost of being tested weekly. Then other places started requiring you to be vaccinated to work which people really felt impeded on their liberty and rights of freedom. Protests are going on all over the place because so many libertarians were outraged with those rules. Libertarians feel so strongly about the subject that a health department leader that scolded those who were not vaccinated giot put on leave for just speaking his mind (even though it was inappropriate to say to work colleagues). Freedom of speech should also be fought for just as much as the right to not get vaccinated but it seems that speaking your opinion might be as dangerous as declaring a mandate because the lines of libertarianism are so blurry now. 
<br><br>

         Their counter to the mask mandate would usually entail saying that they did not need the mask to protect themselves because they would be fine and to everyone else who wanted to be protected should just stay home or keep their own mask on and not worry about theirs. In this case I feel as if libertarianism was more negative and harmed more people than if they were to just abide by the mandates because not masking up could and did hurt more people than if everyone just wore a mask. Then the bigger controversy of getting vaccinated sparked even more thoughts on what freedom really was in the United States. At first it was just highly encouraged that everyone got the vaccine but that quickly changed. Talk of the vaccine being necessary to do certain things started going around and became very real. Social events and certain workplaces started requiring proof that you were vaccinated to allow you to enter. People felt that this was wrong, that they had to be vaccinated to enjoy certain things in their life. However, that was just the beginning, workplaces started discussing plans and policies regarding the vaccine and how it would affect where some people worked. For example some places gave you an option, you could either get tested weekly or simply get the vaccine.<br><br>

         Eventually we found a vaccine that worked and was tested enough that the CDC said it was safe for public use. However, instead of making the world calmer by knowing there was a vaccine it seemed to tear this nation and other parts of the world apart. People were arguing with each other whether the vaccine was safe or not. While people were wondering if the vaccine was safe or not, politicians started spreading different ideas and making the vaccine more political than about the safety of the general public. They started to use the vaccine mandates and covid policies to gain followers while telling the people whatever they could to agree with their same ideas. With all the mandates and policies that kept changing and coming out as time went on with Covid many people felt that their liberty was at stake now. From the start people felt their freedom was being taken away and especially Libertarians felt that their beliefs were being violated. Starting with the mask mandates, libertarians were furious because being forced to wear a mask in public made them feel as if they had been stripped of their right to be free and express themselves however they liked
